    "content": "I recently solved a real-world problem: splitting prepaid electricity bills among 3 families fairly based on sub-meter readings. Instead of building an app, I created a Google Sheet that:\n\n- Calculates unit consumption per family\n- Determines the actual cost per unit from net recharge (after VAT)\n- Applies government slab-wise billing rules (e.g., 0–50 units @ 4.63 BDT, 51–75 @ 5.26 BDT, etc.)\n- Uses Excel formulas like `=MAX(0, (MIN(end, slab_to) - slab_from) * rate)` to dynamically calculate charges slab by slab\n\nThe total always matches the net recharge amount, and the result is clean and fair for everyone involved. This is a great example of how powerful spreadsheets can be for everyday finance problems without needing to write code!",
